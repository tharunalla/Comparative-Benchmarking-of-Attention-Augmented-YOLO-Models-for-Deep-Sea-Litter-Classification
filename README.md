# Comparative-Benchmarking-of-Attention-Augmented-YOLO-Models-for-Deep-Sea-Litter-Classification
This project presents a real-time deep learning system for detecting marine debris—specifically cloth, metal, glass, and plastic—using optimized YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models. A total of 17 YOLO variants, including attention-augmented models and hybrid architectures with ResNet backbones, were evaluated on a custom Roboflow-annotated dataset sourced from the JAMSTEC Deep-Sea Debris Database. Among all tested models, the YOLOv11s with dual CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Modules) at Layers 14 and 21 demonstrated the best performance, achieving a precision of 0.73 and mAP@0.5 of 0.618. This system provides a scalable, efficient solution for autonomous underwater waste monitoring, with potential integration in AUVs and edge devices.
